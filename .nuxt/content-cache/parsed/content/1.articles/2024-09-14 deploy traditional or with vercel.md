Traditionally, developers had to go through a complex process involving configuring servers, managing environments, and ensuring the smooth delivery of updates. However, modern platforms like Vercel have revolutionized the deployment process. They provide a streamlined, serverless way to deploy applications, removing many of the hassles associated with traditional methods.
